•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  My code was both functional and secure by eliminating any syntax errors or warnings that could disrupt the operation    of my program, addressing these issues as necessary. Furthermore, code coverage serves as a valuable metric for         assessing the overall effectiveness of my JUnit tests, indicating the proportion of my tested code. A significant       level of test coverage suggests that my tests effectively evaluate a large segment of the code. Conversely, low code    coverage implies that my tests are insufficient and fail to assess an adequate amount of the code.

•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  Adhering to the Software Requirements and ensuring their integration into the application are vital in understanding    user requirements. Furthermore, verifying that the input aligns with the anticipated output is essential.

•	How do I approach designing software?

  The critical aspect lies in understanding the software requirements. Moreover, I ensured my code was well-structured    using proper indentation and comments. I arranged each function in a logical sequence. For instance, I positioned       all header files at the start of my code, followed by the function prototypes and global variables.
